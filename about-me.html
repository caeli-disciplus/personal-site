        <h1>A little about myself...</h1>
        <p>
            Born in the heart of Portugal, between two beautifull montains there
            lays FundÃ£o, my hometown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being surroudend by two majestic landscapes while growing up
            influenced me to cherish the diversity of life, being inquisitive of
            my surroundings, and admire the beauty of it... So when the
            opportunity to be immersed in it arises, is when I feel the most
            serene and whole.

            Now sentimentalism aside I went to do my bachelor's in Escola
            Superior de Tecnologia member of the Instituto PolitÃ©cnico de Castelo
            Branco, where I graduated in TIM (Information Technologies and
            Multimedia). And while there I had the opportunity to study abroad one
            year in Czech Republic and one semester in Macau.

            After completing my studies I went to live in Lisbon where I worked for 5 years, in multiple companies.
            Until starting a new journey...

            Following love I came to "sunny" ðŸ˜‰ Brussels and I've started a new chapter of my life!
